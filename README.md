- Brief summary of my project work, along with detailed instructions on executing the project or specific files.

### Project Description
The project app is a comprehensive health monitoring system comprising three major components: Mood Management, Fall Detection, and Health Monitoring. Each component addresses specific aspects of user well-being, contributing to an intelligent and proactive health management system.

#### Execution Instructions:
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook environment.
2. Load and execute the `Drug_Recommendation_code.ipynb` notebook.
3. Follow the provided instructions for embedding the dataset and training the Bi-Directional LSTM model.

### Important Notes:
- Ensure necessary permissions are granted for call recording and emergency contact access on Android devices.
- For the fall detection component, make sure the APK is installed on a compatible Android device with the required sensors.
- Ensure the Jupyter Notebook environment is configured with the necessary libraries (tensorflow) for executing the Drug Recommendation code.
